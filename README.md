When working in mines or caves or other places without good lighting, it's essential that you be able to see what you are doing. An ordinary headlamp might be a good solution, but a headlamp doesn't track what you're working on so you can always see it, and whenever you turn your head to talk to someone, that someone is blinded by bright light that streams out of your forehead. It would be so much easier if your head lamp new automatically where to point its impressive beacon.
